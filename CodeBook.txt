Table Names

Source Data
1. testdataX (2947 obs, 561 variables)
2. traindataX (7352 obs, 561 variables)   
3. testdataY (2947 obs, 1 variable - activity variable re: testdataX records)
4. traindataY (7352 obs, 1 variable - activity variable re: traindataX records)
5. activitylabels (6 obs, 2 variables - activity description for activity variable in testdataY and traindataY tables)
6. features (561 obs, 2 variables - names of the observations in testdataX and testdataY tables)
7. subject_test (2947 obs, 1 variable - subject variable re: testdataX records)
8. subject_train (7352 obs, 1 variable - subject variable re: traindataX records)

Output Data Frames
1. prjdata (10299 obs, 564 variables)
	- Composition of the eight source data files, manipulated into a master data table
	- Column names added from features source data
	- Columns added - activity and subject variables
	- Test and Train datasets combined
	- Narrowed to 69 variables in manipulation below

2. tidydf (180 obs, 35 variables)
	- Trimmed version of master prjdata table (limited to 'mean' measurements)
	- Summarized by subject and activity

** indicate where the above dataframes and any interim dataframes were created in the manipulation process
* indicate where new variables or new variable names were introduced

Core Process Steps

1. Read tables in (as outlined in Source Data above)

2. Add / Update column names for each table
	- The observation names in the features table were added to testdataX and traindataY tables as column names.
*	- The testdataY and traindataY columns were renamed to 'actnum' (interpret as activity number)
*	- The activitylabels columns were remaned to 'actnum' and 'actdesc' (interpret as activity description)...to facilitate merge (ultimately followed subset method)
*	- The subject_test and subject_train columns were renamed to 'subjectnum' (interpret as subject number)


3. Add activity labels to Y tables (using subset approach)
*	- actdesc values from activitylabels table were added via subset method to testdataY and traindataY tables
	- per activitylabels table
		1 = "WALKING"
		2 = "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
		3 = "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
		4 = "SITTING"
		5 = "STANDING"
		6 = "LAYING"


4. Update observation tables (testdataX and traindataX) by binding addition columns containing activity and subject variables
	- testdataX and traindataX contain different observations, but are exact structure


5. Bind testdataX and traindataX tables to create master project data frame
**	- 'prjdata' is the new dataframe created (10299 obs, 564 variables)

6. Trim project data frame to include only mean and std(standard deviation) values
	- 'prjdata' now 69 variables down from 564	


7. Trim dataframe down to only mean values, reorder columns and clean column names
**	- 'tidydata' is new dataframe created (10299 obs, 35 variables)
	- The observations (column names) can be inpreted exactly how they are structured in the following dataset (and as contained in the features source data):
	
		http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

*	- The observation names have been scrubbed to remove all "-", "()", and " " characters and all text was made lowercase.


8. Group and summarize (tidydata) by subject and activity in new data frame
**	- bysubact is an alternative version of tidydata that is grouped by subject and activity
**	- tidydf is a new dataframe that summarizes the mean of each observation in bysubact by subject and activity (180 obs, 35 variables)

9. Create txt file of tidydf (using write.table function)
